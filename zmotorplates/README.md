# Laser Cut Z Motor Plates for Jubilee Toolchanger 3D Printer

You will need to cut one of back_zplate.dxf and two of front_zplates.dxf.

Optional, print two each of the guides, and three of the motor spacers. If desired, you can mirror one each of the guides.

Services like OSHCut, Big Blue Saw, or SendCutSend are a good starting place if you don't have the tools to cut these yourself. I used SendCutSend, as at the time they had the best prices.

I had them cut out of .25" 5052 Aluminum, but you could almost certainly get away with something a little thinner.
